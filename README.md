# NLP_ZNU_Course_Project
This repo contains the files related to the NLP Course assignments during the 8th semester at Zanjan University.

The series of files have been uploaded in this repo and each one of them is related to the correspounding assignment. 

On the first assignment the goal was to :
 - create a (Persian - English / English to Persian) Dictionary which translates the words based on their appearing frequency.

On the second assignment the goal was to :
 - create and apply MaxLength algorithm from scratch and use to find simmilarity metric for text classification
 - we used the same dataset(Hamshahri NewsLetter) for both steps, you can find it here.

On the third assignment the goal was to :
 - design the Inverted Index unit in order to deploy the Boolean Model to do the Retrival task on the data.
 - In other words, we need to create a program that takes a QUERY from the user and after analysing that QUERY (By using first part of the project), retrives the most relevant data to the user by using Inverted Index Mechanism.

The last part of the assignment was :
 - deploying the Naive Baise classifier from scratch on the data set and Evaluating the Model using Accuracy Metric.
